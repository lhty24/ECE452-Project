# Palm Piano
## ECE-452 Project

Palm Piano is a piano keyboard app which enables uses to compose & playback music, import and export MIDI files, and entertain with rhythm games.

The app contains three modes:

### 1) Composition Mode
This mode allows users to compose music and record them. It offers a fully functional keyboard in the view to users, and enables them to play around, try out the tunes in their head, and record the tunes.

### 2) Playback Mode
This mode can play the music selected by users, and show the sheet music at the same time. In this mode, the upper half of the view is the keyboard, while the bottom half is the sheet music which scrolls as the music plays. The playback mode is designed to help users to better understand the music as well as musical notation and music theory. 

### 3) Game Mode
This mode is essentially a rhythm game. When the game starts, colorful boxes start to fall onto the keys of the piano which are synchronized with the music, the user has to hit the corresponding keys to collect points. The game mode offers light entertainment to the users.
